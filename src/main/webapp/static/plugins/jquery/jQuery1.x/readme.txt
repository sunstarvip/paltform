The jQuery 1.x line had major changes as of jQuery 1.9.0. We strongly recommend
that you also use the jQuery Migrate plugin if you are upgrading from pre-1.9
versions of jQuery or need to use plugins that haven't yet been updated.
Read the jQuery 1.9 Upgrade Guide and the jQuery 1.9 release blog post for more information.
